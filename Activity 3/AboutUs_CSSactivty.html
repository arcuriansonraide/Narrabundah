            	<h3> Our History </h3> 
                	<p> Natalia’s Restaurant first opened in June 1997. Since then, the small Italian franchise has become one of the most well-known restauraunts in Australia. Currently only located in Western Sydney, there are hopes that the franchise will expand to other parts of Australia, however the owners, Mario and Eva Genovesi are very happy with their restaurant being a ‘must see’ place when visiting Sydney as it is unique to that area. </p> </li> 
			
            <li> 
                <h3> Our Culture </h3> 
                	<p> We are a restauraunt run by a close Italian family who always dreamed of sharing their food and love for cooking with the world. The restaurant caters for all ages of any nationality. Being Italian’s, we know the importance of family, whether it be big or small, therefore our restaurant does not limit the size of any group bookings. It is our mission to create a wonderful experience between friends and family.</p> </li> 
			
            <li> 
 				<h3> Major Events </h3> 
                	<p> In 2004, Natalia’s restauraunt attempted to make a new world record for the ‘World’s largest Pizza’. Unfortunately they came up short, however, their pizza was able to feed almost 2000 guests in the restauraunt. This event occurred on the 20th of October and is celebrated anually within the franchise. Each year on this day, the family invite the homeless in that area of Sydney into their restauraunt, which they refer to as their home, and they feed them Pizza, free of charge. </p> </li> 
                    
			<li> 
            	<h3> Mama Natalia </h3> 
                		<p> Natalia’s restauraunt is named after Mario Genovesi’s late mother, Natalia. She taught Mario everything he knows about food and has claimed to be the one who discovered his talent as a chef. It was her dying wish that Mario were to share his gift with the world and thanks to the devotion of his wife and family, this dream soom became a reality. </p>
