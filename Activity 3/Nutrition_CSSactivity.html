			<p {text: align="left"> Our mission is to make our guests understand why there is a great love for Italian Food around the Globe. We want all of our guests to leave our restaurant feeling welcomed, loved and as if they are now a part of our new family. Most importantly we want them to feel full and not leave hungry. We not only want our food to taste good, but also make you feel good. Italian food is often assiciated as being high in carbohydrates and high in fat, however we aim to challenge this idea. We use only the freshest ingrediants of the highest quality, many of which are sourced locally. We avoid using mass-produced and processed ingrediants as we believe that these are negative influences to you health abd in order to achieve this, we ensure all of our customers that all our meals are made and served fresh. We we aim to avoid making our guests feel heavy, bloated or guilty after eating at our restaurant. Therefore, by preparing meals containing locally sourced, natual and freshly prepared incrediants that have multiple health benefits, our food is contributing positively to your health. We are so confident of this that included of this webpage is a link to a website which contains a "Daily Intake Guide" below, so you can check it out for yourself. </p>
